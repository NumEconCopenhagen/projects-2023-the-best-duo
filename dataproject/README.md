# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Study case: The affect of net migration on the US and Romania** and it is about to explain the relation between net migration and gdp, employment ratio, labor force and wage in two countries, the Unites States and Romania.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).
We also used the [plot_function.py](plot_function.py) to plot the dataframes.
