# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Study case: The affect of net migration on the US and Romania** and it is about to explain the relation between net migration and gdp, employment ratio, labor force and wage in two countries, the Unites States and Romania.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).
We also used the .py-file *plot_function* to plot the dataframes.

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. migration.csv (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SM.POP.NETM) 
2. gdp.csv (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD)
3. employment_ratio.csv (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.EMP.TOTL.SP.ZS)
4. labour_force.csv (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.TOTL.IN)
5. wage.csv (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.EMP.WORK.ZS)
