Our project is composed of three problems.

The first is about optimal taxation with government consumption, the second one about the labor adjustment cost and the last one about global optimizer with refined multi-start.

The results of the problem 1 can be seen from running [Exam-2023-notebook.ipynb](Exam-2023-notebook.ipynb). We also used the .py-file problem1.
