# Inaugural project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

Moreover, we also used the functions from the .py-files in *loop_alpha_sigma*.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
